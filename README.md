This project is a re-implementation of the GPU parts from the GPU-Euler de novo genome assembler. GPU-Euler was 
limited to using one computer's GPU and thus the size of genome was limited to bacteria, viruses, etc. This project 
will expand that assembler by enabling distribution of the assembly over several compute node's GPUs.
